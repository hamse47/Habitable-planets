# Habitable-planets

## Overview
The Habitable Planets is a Node.js application that leverages data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to identify exoplanets that may be habitable. This tool processes extensive astronomical data, focusing on exoplanets and their host stars, and applies specific criteria to filter out those that might support habitable environments.
